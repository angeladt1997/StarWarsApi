# StarWarsApi

This code should allow users to acces the Star Wars API in order to look up galaxies, character names, and other attributes. The requirements for the app can be found here:

Write a React app which allows users to search the Star Wars API for a character name, and displays the matching characters
For example, a search for "Skywalker" should list "Luke Skywalker", "Anakin Skywalker" and "Shmi Skywalker"
The app must be deployed using the Vercel CLI
Note that we've deployed our own version of the Star Wars API, so requests you make should go to https://swapi-thinkful.herokuapp.com/api/, instead of https://swapi.co/api/.

Bonus points are awarded for:

Gracefully displaying a loading indicator, and handling error conditions
Being able to select whether you want to search for planets, spaceships, vehicles, characters, films or species
A passing test suite
